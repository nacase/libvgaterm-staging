libvgaterm
==========

libvgaterm is a library that provides a VGA text mode terminal Gtk+ widget.


Run-time dependencies
=====================

In general, the primary dependency of libvgaterm is Gtk+ 2.8 (or newer in the
2.x series).  Python and pygtk are also required if you are using the
(highly recommended) Python bindings.

Below is a list of package names you can install which should pull in all
the required dependencies.  Package names vary depending on which Linux
distribution you are using.

Debian/Ubuntu (apt-get install X):
	libgtk2.0-0 python-gtk2

Fedora/Red Hat (yum install X):
	gtk2 pygtk2


Compiling from source
=====================

If you're building this library from source, you will need the associated
development packages for Gtk+ 2.x and pygtk:

Debian/Ubuntu (apt-get install X):
	libgtk2.0-dev python-dev python-gtk2-dev

Fedora/Red Hat (yum install X):
	gtk2-devel python-devel pygtk2-devel

If you are building directly from the git repository rather than using a
release tarball, additional dependencies and steps are required.  First,
ensure that you have installed autoconf, automake, and libtool on your system.
Then, run "./autogen.sh" from the top-level build directory to generate the
configure script.

Run the following three commands to configure, compile, and install the
library:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

See the 'INSTALL' file for more details.
